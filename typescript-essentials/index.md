## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: In this module I learned about TypeScript history and that TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. Now I know how to install TypeScript and how to compile a TypeScript file.

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: In this module I learned about types in TypeScript, how to add them to the project. Most interesting and useful parts about union types and collection types, I think.

3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: In this module I learned about interfaces, how to declare it, the ability to extend it. Now I know, that interfaces have differences from type aliases.

4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: In this module I learned how to write functions with required, optional, default, and rest parameters. It's interesting, that I can define not only primitives, but even function types using type aliases or interfaces.

5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: In this module I learned how to declare and instantiate a class using TypeScript, how to extend them from another class. I learned the difference between classes and interfaces, when to use each other.

6. **Generics in TypeScript**: This module was the most difficult to understand. I learned how to define a generic function, declare a generic interface and class, how to implement generic constraints. But I need to search more information about it to fully understand.

7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: In this module I learned how to organize code using modules and import an external type library. Part about libraries wasn't very useful, because every case needs to find different solution.

8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: In this module I learned about namespaces, that it's possible to implement namespaces within a single TypeScript file and across multiple TypeScript files. I need more practice to understand TypeScript. Exercises in these modules don't show all problems and cases of using namespaces.
