Hello! My name is Ekaterina and I want to be a front-end developer. I don't have a computer science education, so I have to search and read a lot to do tasks in time. It is really hard for me, and it's a challenge at the same time. When I heard about RS School for the first time I said to myself, that I will finish this JS course and will get a job as a front-end developer. I hope it comes true.

I have a degree in a book publishing. But a few years ago I realized that this sphere is dying, and almost all books and articles are on the internet now. So, I decided to learn web programming as a closest field of activity to my education. I worked as a search engine optimizator, where I found out about html and css, and learned how to create simple web-pages. Then I worked as a site administrator, but my knowledge wasn't enough to be a good worker. Now I'm here, learning hard, doing my homework all days long.

I prefer front-end over back-end, because it's closer to the book publishing. I see the result of my work and I can show it to the others, the same as printed books.

I chose web-programming, because it changes all the time. Everyone, who wants to be a good web-programmer, should learn a lot every day.

I don't have a lot of experience yet. I tried to make a few sites, but didn't finish them. And I didn't use JS in my work before, so I'm new here. But I have a lot of desire to learn and use new information in my future work.

This course has a lot of JS tasks, but when I do them (on the codewars, for example), it doesn't get me any closer to the web-development. I learned JS basics, but how can I apply it to the web-pages? That's a question, because I don't understand enough these moments. I wish there will be more tasks where we will use JavaScript to access and manipulate DOM objects.

By the way, this task is harder than other ones, because I am an introvert. Interviews terrify me a lot. Even if I know something, I forget all I know, even my name. How did I create this video? Really, I don't know. It's a miracle! I think that's all. Goodbye!
